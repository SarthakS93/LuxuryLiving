TravelEasy project is in the save file directory.
I used a JSP instead of a servlet.
Also used Http requests instead of google maps sdk.
This project needs internet connection to run.

Hotel listing and fibonacci series in LuxuryLiving directory.
I used a linked list to implement the Hotel listing question.
Just run the Hotel.java file and notice the output on the console.
